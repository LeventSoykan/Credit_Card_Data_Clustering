Credit Card Data Clustering
===========================

This project aims to perform clustering analysis on credit card data to identify patterns and group similar customers together. The dataset contains information about credit card holders, including their credit limits, balances, payment status, and demographic data.

The project is broken down into the following steps:

1.  **Data Collection:** The raw data is obtained from an online dataset repository and is in CSV format.
    
2.  **Data Cleaning:** The raw data is cleaned using Python and the Pandas library. The data is inspected for any missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. 
    
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis:** The cleaned data is then used to explore the distribution of the features and to identify any correlations between them.
    
4.  **Data Preprocessing:** The data is preprocessed by standardizing the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
    
5.  **Model Building:** The preprocessed data is then used to build clustering models using the K-Means algorithm.
    
6.  **Model Evaluation:** The performance of the clustering models is evaluated using various metrics, including silhouette score, elbow plot, and dendrogram.
    

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   Python
*   Pandas

How to Use
----------

To run this project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Run the Jupyter notebook `credit_card_clustering.ipynb` to clean the data, perform the analysis, and build the clustering models.
4.  The resulting graphs and visualizations will be displayed in the notebook.

Files
-----

*   `cc_general.csv`: The raw data obtained from the online dataset repository.
*   `clustering.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and model building.

Future Improvements
-------------------

This project can be improved in the following ways:

*   Using other clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN to compare their performance with K-Means.
*   Observing the clustered groups further tor recognize their main characteristics.)
